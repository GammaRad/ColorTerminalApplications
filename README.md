# SnakeTerminalPython
Full color snake game with live user input right in the terminal. 7 Lines (optimized, that is why its so small), uses minimal modules, and game rendering is all in puure python. 
# What is needed to run this program
This is a program written in python 3.9.13 . If you have a newer version of python, I doubt things will break but keep it in mind. 
The keyboard functionality requires your device to be compatible with the msvcrt module. I am fairly certain msvcrt only works for WINDOWS operating system
In order for the program to work properly, your terminal should be able to render ANSI escape code. If you do not know if your terminal does render ANSI escape code, simply run the program and if you  see a grey rectangle with red and green dots then the program is running fine.
